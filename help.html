				<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
				<p>The Ministry of Justice has a zero tolerance policy towards instances of bullying, discrimination, & harassment. If you have seen or experienced anything that you believe may be inappropriate, we encourage you to talk to your line manager in the first instance.</p>

					<b>Your line manager</b>

					<p>Your line manager should be your first point of contact for most instances of bullying & harassment. They are there to provide advice, help you to access mediation, or to file a grievance if necessary. If you feel that your line manager is not the appropriate contact, your line manager's line manager should be able to assist.</p>

					<b>Anti-bullying & harassment advisors</b>

					<p>A number of Ministry of Justice employees are trained anti-bullying & harassment advisors, and can provide confidential, in-person advice. You can find one of these advisors to speak to <a href="advice_offer.html">here</a>.</p>

					<b>Workplace Mediation</b>
					
					<p>Workplace mediation is available to all civil service employees through PAM Assist, our Employee Assistance Programme. Mediation is recommended as an alternative to the formal grievance process for relationship difficulties, interpersonal conflict, communication breakdown, differences in working style and perceived discrimination, harassment & bullying. If you'd like to access the workplace mediation service, you'll need a formal referral from your line manager.</p>

						How do I file a grievance?
					</a>
				</label>
				<input type="checkbox" style="opacity: 0" id="toggle-2">
				<div class="row reveal-if-active">
					<p>Your line manager can assist with filing a grievance if you feel that that's the appropriate step. This should follow on from an informal investigation. If you feel that your line manager is not the appropriate contact, your line manager's line manager should be able to assist.</p>

					<p>It is expected that you will have attempted to address the issue with the individual concerned prior to raising a formal grievance. If your grievance contact feels that you have not made attempts to address the issue informally, they may ask to postpone an investigation until an informal resolution has been explored.</p>

						How are grievances investigated?
					</a>
				</label>
				<input type="checkbox" style="opacity: 0" id="toggle-7">
				<div class="row reveal-if-active">
					<p>Grievance investigations are organised by your line manager where appropriate. However, you may report a grievance to your line manager's line manager or an alternative line manager where preferred. Once a grievance is filed, your grievance contact should organise a thorough investigation into the incident. They may choose to conduct this investigation themselves; however, it is likely that another point of contact will be asked to lead the investigation to ensure impartiality.</p>

					<p>The investigation process will involve talking through the grievance report with both parties, as well as with any other employees that might have witnessed the incident. Once the investigation has been completed, your grievance contact will decide on an appropriate course of action. This will be communicated back to you and the subject of your grievance.</p>

					<p>Your grievance contact will inform the subject of your grievance that an investigation is being conducted. While the grievance process is ongoing, neither you nor the subject of your grievance should discuss the grievance, either with each other, or with other employees.</p>

					<p>Due to the complex nature of these investigations, the grievance process can take many months to complete. During this time, your grievance contact should make provisions for you and/or the subject of your grievance to have alternative working arrangements.</p>

						What constitutes bullying and harassment?
					</a>
				</label>
				<input type="checkbox" style="opacity: 0" id="toggle-3">
				<div class="row reveal-if-active">
					<p>Harassment is unwanted behaviour which affects a person's dignity. It can relate to age, gender, sexual orientation, race, disability, religion, nationality, gender identity or any other personal characteristic of the individual and may be continuous or a one-off incident. Basically, the actions or comments are seen by the person receiving them as demeaning and unacceptable.</p>

					<p>Bullying may include offensive, intimidating, malicious or insulting behaviour or an abuse of misuse of power which aims to undermine, humiliate or injure someone.  Bullying or harassment may be by an individual against an individual or involve groups of people.</p>

					<p>A non-exhaustive collection of examples of bullying & harassment can be found on <a href="#">the intranet</a>.</p>

					<p>Some individuals may perceive certain actions as bullying or harassment where other individuals do not. If you feel that anything you have seen or experienced may be inappropriate, you are encouraged to talk about it with your line manager, or with an anti-bullying & harassment advisor.</p>
