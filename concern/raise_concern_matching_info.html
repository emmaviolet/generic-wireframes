      <h4>How does matching work?</h4>

      <p>Our matching system allows you to raise a concern about an individual only if someone else in your organisation also raises a concern with the same person. That means that you only come forward if the issue is not a one-off.</p>

      <label for="toggle-1" style="display: inline;">
        <a style="font-weight:normal; text-decoration: underline;">
          What happens if my concern is matched?
        </a>
      </label>
      <input type="checkbox" style="opacity: 0" id="toggle-1">
      <div class="row reveal-if-active height-1000">
        <p>What happens if Emma and John both raise a concern about Lucy?</p>

        <p>Once Emma and John have both added their concerns to our database, their concerns will 'match' - because they both identify Lucy as the subject of their concern. When this happens, both Emma's and John's details will be sent immediately to the people they said they wanted to be contacted.</p>

        <p>Emma named her line manager, David, as the person she'd like her concern to be sent to, so the details that Emma gave us will be sent immediately to David. We'll also let David know that a separate concern has been raised about Lucy, and give him the details of John's contact so that he can follow up.</p>

        <p>John asked for his concern to be sent to George, so we'll send the details that John gave us directly to George. We'll also let George know that a separate concern has been raised about Lucy, and give George David's contact details so that he can follow up. We won't tell George who raised the other concern.</p>

        <p>We'll also email both Emma and John to let them know that their concern was matched, and that they should expect to hear from David and George.</p>

      <label for="toggle-2" style="display: inline;">
        <a style="font-weight:normal; text-decoration: underline;">
          What happens if my concern is not matched?

      <div class="row reveal-if-active height-1000">
        <p>We don't want to keep unmatched concerns on our database forever. You might change your mind about coming forward; you might leave the company; or you might want to opt out of the matching process because you've decided to come forward on your own.</p>

        <p>So, if your concern is on our database for a year, and remains unmatched, we'll send you an email to check whether you want us to keep it there. If you'd rather opt out, we'll delete it from our database, and it'll be like it never existed at all.</p>

        <p>You can add a concern into the matching system by clicking on 'raise a concern' from our home page. That will take you through the process to raise a concern, and ask you how you would like your concern to be raised. When you get there, just click the option to 'wait and send if matched' and we'll take it from there.</p>

        <p>You can also click on the 'start' button below to get going.</p>
